I am an associate professor in physical oceanography at School of Marine Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University (SYSU), China. Before that, I did postdoc research in Laboratoire d'Oc√©anographie Physique et Spatiale (LOPS) at Ifremer, France, and obtained my PhD at the University of Southampton, UK. 

With great enthusiasm for ocean observations, my research centers on upper-ocean dynamical processes. My interest is the motion at the submesoscale, and I mainly use observational data collected from moorings, drifting buoys, seagliders, and satellites.

During my postdoc, I worked on a SWOT-related project, in which we try to describe and improve our ability to disentangle internal waves and quasi-geostrophic motions. Outputs from tide- and eddy-resolving ocean models are used as our testbed.
