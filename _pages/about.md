I am a postdoc researcher in Laboratoire d'Oc√©anographie Physique et Spatiale (LOPS) at Ifremer, Brest, France. Before that, I obtained my PhD in the University of Southampton, UK. My research focuses on upper-ocean dynamics ranging from unbalanced inertia-gravity waves to geostrophic mesoscale eddies. I mainly use in situ observations from moorings and drifters, and simulations from numerical models.
