I am a postdoc researcher in Laboratoire d'Oc√©anographie Physique et Spatiale (LOPS) at Ifremer, France. Before that, I obtained my PhD in the University of Southampton, UK. My research focuses on upper-ocean dynamics associated with a wide range of processes, from geostrophically balanced mesoscale eddies, submesoscale unstable instabilities to unbalanced inertia-gravity waves. I mainly use in situ observations collected from moorings, surface drifters and satellite altimeters, and simulations from realistic and idealized numerical models.
