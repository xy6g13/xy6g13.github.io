I am a postdoctoral researcher at Laboratoire d'Oc√©anographie Physique et Spatiale (LOPS) in Ifremer, Brest, France. Before that, I obtained my PhD in the University of Southampton, UK. 
My research focuses on upper-ocean dynamics associated with a wide range of processes, from geostrophically balanced mesoscale eddies, submesoscale unstable fronts to unbalanced inertia-gravity waves. I mainly use in situ observations collected from moorings, seagliders, surface drifting buoys and satellite altimeters, and simulation outputs from tide- and eddy-resolving high-resolution ocean models.
