I am currently a postdoctoral researcher of Laboratoire d'Oc√©anographie Physique et Spatiale (LOPS) at Ifremer, Brest, France. Before that, I obtained my PhD in the University of Southampton, UK. 

With great enthusiasm for ocean observations, my research centers on upper-ocean processes. My interest is the motion at the submesoscale, and I mainly use observational data collected from moorings, drifting buoys, seagliders, and satellites.

During my postdoc, I have been working on a SWOT-related project, in which we try to describe and improve our ability to disentangle internal waves and quasi-geostrophic motions. Outputs from tide- and eddy-resolving ocean models are used as our testbed. 

I'm also putting more time now to understand fluid dynamics mathematically and theoretically, which I believe is essential for my long-term research career.
