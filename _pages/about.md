I am a postdoc researcher in Laboratoire d'Oc√©anographie Physique et Spatiale (LOPS) at Ifremer, France. Before that, I obtained my PhD in the University of Southampton, UK. My research focuses on upper-ocean dynamics ranging from unbalanced inertia-gravity waves to geostrophically balanced motions. I mainly use in situ observations from moorings and drifters, and simulations from realistic and idealized numerical models.
